# How to study maths at university

## Introduction
At my university up to 30-40% of students fail each math course in the first year. It is very rare that someone goes through the first year without having failed a single math course,For most people it is just a matter of getting through it. This is a shame.

The people making these courses have an incredible amount of knowledge, and as students, it is the perfect opportunity to just drink the knowledge. It is excactly that this module is going to cover.

A few years ago I took a course called [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). One result from that course was an article about [how to prepare your brain for learning](https://medium.com/@tskarhed/prepare-your-brain-for-learning-369335cd1380). This module is a concrete application of the article.

### Become and stay interested in maths
It is hard to do hard work unless you have a strong enough reason for it. Therefore you need to build some kind of intrensic motivation. There are great resources out there that are meant to inspire mathematics and how to use it in fun ways! Take notes!

Movies:
- (Good Will Hunting)[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/]
- (The Man Who Knew Infinity)[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/]
